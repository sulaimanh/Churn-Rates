# Churn-Rates
Using an ANN to predict whether a customer will leave a bank or not

A bank has been seeing unusual churn rates. Customers are leaving at unusual high rates.
The bank will use this model, that we just validated on the test set, on the customers of the bank

The bank will then be able to apply the model on all the customers of the bank and by ranking the probabilities from the 
highest to the lowest, it gets a ranking of the customers most likely to leave the bank. 

This ANN creates a lot of added value to the bank because by targeting these customers most likely to leave the bank, the bank itself can take some measures to prevent these customers from leaving.
